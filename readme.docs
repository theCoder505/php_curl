Hey!

This is a file what will have almost 2000 buttons in it in future... 
So, it's imp to look after the loading speed... 

So, data is called by ajax after the entire page once loads... 
So, the data need to be called by ajax... 

While any button been added, notice:  

this -------->
  $url0 = $("#0").data("remote");
:small_airplane:
and this ------>
    $.post("ajax.php", {
        sendingTo: "urls",
        mainurl: $url0
    }, function (data, status) {
        $("#0").attr("data-original-title", data);
    });


 code is better to uplpoad directly to database and fetch it from databse while it loads by a while loop, 
 these will make the javascript call using php and database; easier hope so...

 You also can do either easier process for work... 
 This is how I thought... 

 Some process are also clearified in the "scripts.php"  file... Read the reasons I mentioned... 

Thanks... Happy Coding... 🛩️🥈🥈🛩️
